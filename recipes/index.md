# OpenTransact Recipes

How to implement common use cases in OpenTransact.

A common question of OpenTransact since it is very simple is how it can be used to implement more complex applications.

The goal of these specs is to build up best practices. Please feel free to add new ones to the [wiki](https://github.com/opentransact/opentransact/wiki) or [fork us](https://github.com/opentransact/opentransact.github.com) and create new ones or changes.

The end result of these may become further smaller standards.
